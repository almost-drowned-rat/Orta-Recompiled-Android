/**
 * Panzer Dragoon Orta - manual function overrides and ICALL diagnostics.
 *
 * Origin: sp00nznet/xboxrecomp templates/new-game/src/recomp_manual.c
 *         (commit 193e299, MIT), see docs/sources.md.
 *
 * Rule (CLAUDE.md): bugs are fixed in the lifter, never in generated C.
 * Workarounds go here as overrides, each with a comment: why, address,
 * how it was verified.
 *
 * This file provides:
 *   - recomp_lookup_manual()  : intercept specific Xbox VAs with hand-written code
 *   - recomp_icall_fail_log() : log when an indirect call target can't be resolved
 *   - ICALL trace ring buffer  : globals used by the RECOMP_ICALL macro
 *
 * The recomp pipeline generates an auto-dispatch table (recomp_lookup) that
 * resolves most function addresses. recomp_lookup_manual() is called FIRST,
 * giving you a chance to override any function with a custom implementation.
 *
 * Common reasons to add manual overrides:
 *   - Trace a function to understand call flow (wrap the generated version)
 *   - Fix a function the lifter translated incorrectly
 *   - Stub out a function that crashes (return early, set eax to a safe value)
 *   - Redirect a function to a native implementation (e.g., skip CRT init)
 *   - Intercept D3D/audio calls for custom rendering or sound

/* ── ICALL trace ring buffer ───────────────────────────────── */

/*
 * These globals are written by the RECOMP_ICALL macro (defined in
 * recomp_types.h) every time an indirect call is dispatched. When a
 * crash occurs, the VEH handler or recomp_icall_fail_log() can dump
 * the last 16 call targets to help you trace what happened.
 *
 * The runtime owns them: xbox_kernel defines all three in
 * src/kernel/xbox_memory_layout.c, and recomp_types.h declares them extern.
 * Declare, do not define -- a definition here as well is a duplicate symbol,
 * and a project copied from this template failed to link on all three:
 *
 *   xbox_memory_layout.obj : error LNK2005: g_icall_count already defined
 *                            in recomp_manual.obj

 *
 * XDK 5028 D3D: reads [g_pDevice+0x30] (-> semaphore the GPU writes), compares
 * with [g_pDevice+0x2C] (what the title submitted) and waits until the GPU has
 * caught up. Seen as the hang of run 20261101_113648_m1_wd: device release
 * sub_002AA8F0 -> sub_002B1220 -> sub_002B02B0 -> here, forever (no flip in
 * 40 s, GET == PUT). The fork's pushbuffer executor writes NV2A semaphore
 * releases (method 0x1D70) to the title's real semaphore once everything
 * before them has executed; it only needs the address, once per device.
 * Same pattern as Burnout 3 bench sub_00351770 / THPS 2X sub_00019FE0.
 * Without RECOMP_PB_EXEC this is the generated function unchanged.
 *
 * Wait sleeping, not spinning (profile, 2026-11-03): the attract demo used 0.85-0.9 host cores against 0.40
 * for the reference port (efficiency run 20261103_195256). A sampling profile of the busiest thread (run
 * 20261103_203806_B_sample2) put the main thread 83 % of the time here and in KickOff (sub_002AFD90): BlockOnTime
 * spins in loc_002B0090 reading the GPU semaphore until it has caught up with the caller's target. On the console
 * that ends within the GPU's frame time; here the GPU is the pushbuffer executor on another host thread, and the
 * main thread burnt a whole core meanwhile. The generated exit test (0x2AFF90..0x2AFFB2): done when
 * (put - target) >= (put - *sem), unsigned, put = [dev+0x2C], target = the first stack argument. target == put is
 * left alone (the XDK kicks the pushbuffer off itself first, sub_002AFEE0). Otherwise sleep 0.25 ms per check

/* ── CRI idle-counter thread, sub_00234930: count while sleeping, not spinning (profile, 2026-11-03) ──────────
 *
 * Why: in movie phases the port used 1.0-1.3 host cores against ~0.85 for the reference port (efficiency run
 * 20261103_215401). A sampling profile of the busiest thread during the snow intro movie (run
 * 20261103_223056_B_profmovie2) had one thread 100 % in here: a worker the CRI middleware starts with the movie
 * streams (thread routine 0x00234930, one of the four ctx 0x002349xx workers):
 *
 *     L: inc dword [0x487D28]        ; idle count
 *        cmp dword [0x487D40], 0     ; quit flag

 *        mov dword [0x487D44], 1     ; "ended"
 *        PsTerminateSystemThread(0xF0000001)
 *
 * The middleware's idle meter: on the console it runs at the lowest priority and only gets time nobody else wants,
 * so the count measures idle time. Here it has a host core of its own and burnt all of it. Now it counts once per
 * host millisecond of sleep (host_sleep_ns, no spin) until the quit flag is set; then the generated code runs on and
 * ends the thread exactly as before. The count's rate stays steady, so whatever the middleware derives from it
 * reads the same throughout. To check with every change here: movies still play smoothly (the count could feed
 * CRI's frame-skip logic). */

/* ── Movie teardown race guards (stop-gap; RE 2026-11-03) ─────────────
 *
 * Why: on the console one CPU runs every thread by priority, and Orta's movie code raises its CRI stream thread to
 * TIME_CRITICAL around its work (~80 toggles a second, KeSetBasePriorityThread increment 16 / 0). Here every guest
 * thread has a host core of its own, so the main thread tears a movie down (sub_0023B300 -> DSOUND sub_002BF5A7:
 * the stream's voice released, stream->[0x20] = 0) while the stream worker is still in its service path. A real
 * fix needs a one-CPU scheduler in the toolkit (opt-in, later); the toolkit's time-critical gate (1dede0d) did not
 * help (2 of 3 runs crashed). Until then: the two places the worker dereferences what the teardown freed fail
 * the way the title's own code already fails there, logged the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 8th ... time with the count. The
 * counters are only read and written by the stream worker (one thread), so they need no lock.
 *
 * Evidence: runs 39, 49, B 20261102_020035 / _020658 (37 s, 2 of 2), O 20261102_022611_gate_2 (site 1);
 * O 20261102_022648_gate_3 (site 2).
 *
 * Site 1: sub_002C6319 (DSOUND, `this` in ecx, 1 stack arg, ret 4). Its only caller here, the CDirectSoundStream
 * method sub_002BEA98, takes the DSOUND lock (sub_002BE20D), loads ecx = stream->[0x20] (the stream's voice) and
 * calls it; [ecx+0x12] faulted with ecx = 0 (fault 0x12, edx = stream 0x4B82E0). The check runs inside that lock,
 * so it cannot race the release. ecx = 0: E_FAIL (0x80004005), which sub_002BEA98 returns as its result - the
 * same value its own early-failure path (0x2BEAB9) returns. The caller leaves the lock itself afterwards.
 *
 * Site 2: sub_0023C8F0 (CRI sound output service, cdecl 1 arg = the output object, result unused by its caller
 * 0x23CEA3). It loads ebx = obj->[8] (the sound buffer object) and calls [[ebx]+0x20]; with the vtable pointer
 * [ebx] = 0 (object released) that read faulted at 0x20 (ebx 0x4BE5E0, esi 0x4B7520). No buffer or no vtable:

 *
 * Why: the movie-teardown race. The stream worker (thread routine 0x234970 -> sub_00237910 -> sub_002378B0 ->
 * server function pointer) runs one CRI server pass in sub_00236D90; every crash stack of the race goes through it
 * (0x236D9A: runs 39, 49, B 20261102_020035, O gate_2/gate_3, B 20261103_113202_B_fl30). The main thread destroys
 * the same objects in sub_00236F60 (reached through a function pointer, return address 0x2456A1):
 * ORTA_WATCH_WRITE=4BE5E0 (run 20261103_113357_B_watch) shows it zeroing the output buffer object 0x4BE5E0 (vtable
 * 0x3F6A88, constructed by sub_00237410) on the main thread while a pass was using it - B_fl30 crashed in
 * sub_0023C8F0 between its two virtual calls on that object, past the entry guard. On the console the stream thread
 * runs its pass at TIME_CRITICAL on the one CPU, so the destroy never lands inside a pass; here both run on their
 * own cores. So both take one host lock: a destroy waits for the running pass to end, a pass waits for a running
 * destroy. Both take it before anything else; inside both the title only takes its own locks (DSOUND's) after it,
 * so the order is the same on both sides. A wait over 500 ms goes on without the lock, logged - a stall, never a

 * at half for 2 s whenever the main menu opens.
 * 2026-11-05 (maintainer's OK for the toolkit fix): the toolkit's OHCI model now forwards the output report itself
